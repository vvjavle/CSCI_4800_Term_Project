  <h2>Part A</h2>

    <h3>Introduce Your Problem</h3>

    <p>
      In the pandemic, people are subject to higher rates of anxiety, depression, conflicts with others, and lack of motivation. With this, the lack of physical interaction and social interaction with others along with increased work loads because of the pandemic, remote work has been taxing for many people in their respective fields of work.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem of our study to be in regards to mental health with remote work as a product of the COVID-19 pandemic. While working from home was something that employees enjoyed the convenience of, having to work from home on a daily basis along with juggling the rest of your activities has been hard for many people, and as a result the mental health of individuals has deteriorated.
    </p>

    <h3>7 Stages of Interaction</h3>

      <ol>

        <li> Goal
          <p>To help individuals who have been negatively affected by increase in remote work due to COVID-19 in terms of their physical and mental well being.</p>
        </li>

        <li> Plan (The Action)
          <p>Implementation of an application that allows users to input tasks that they need to complete, and the application will send them reminders throughout their day that will help them both with their physical and mental well being.</p>
        </li>

        <li> Specify (The Action Sequence)
          <p>In terms of mental well being, meditation, mindfulness, and self-reflection will be some of the options that users can use to help them with their mental well being. For the physical well being, basic movements like walking, stretching, and getting out of their office chair to help stimulate their body/increase blood flow will be some of the physical options.</p>
        </li>

        <li> Perform (The Action Sequence)
          <p>Based on the schedule of their work days and the tasks that they have to complete throughout the day, users will be given alerts to their phone or the web app to help them improve their mental and physical well being. These alerts will help promote a more engaging experience for the user and potentially encourage productiveness by boosting a user’s overall well-being</p>
        </li>

        <li> Percieve (The State of the World)
          <p>We perceive the results of executing the actions by making sure that the users are doing the tasks that are assigned throughout the day. This would be done as a rewards system, as users are completing actions, they will be given points that they try to accrue to increase their position on a global leaderboard as another motivating factor to complete tasks.</p>
        </li>

        <li> Interperet (The Perception)
          <p>There will not be much cognitive load to interpret the results as the users will either complete the mental and physical well being tasks, or they will not. In our case, we will measure success by whether the users will successfully report that they have completed a task or they have not. While users in theory could report that they have completed a task, we will rely on a self-reporting system. If the users does not complete a task and reports it as completed, they will only be hurting themselves.</p>
        </li>

        <li> Compare (The Outcome of the Goal)
          <p>As it was stated earlier, the task is considered complete if the user does the physical or mental well-being task that is assigned to them. In our case, the goal will be met as when the users are completing these well-being taks, they will be able to see a tangible increase in their mental and physical well-being.</p>
        </li>

      </ol>

    <h3>Identify Potential Users</h3>

      <p>
        Our users will consist of primarily young adults to middle age adults (typically in the age range of 20-45 years old). These users will most likely be college students and working class individuals who have to do most of their work in a remote environment. According to PWC, employers are expecting a 30 percent shift towards working at home. This pandemic will also most likely possess long-term changes where companies will continue to promote working from (to some degree) as they will need to pay less for maintaining facilities and programs for in person work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The users will take part in the physical and mental well-being exercises that the application would encourage them to do. As mentioned previously these exercises include: meditation, mindfulness, and self-reflection as well as  basic movements like walking, stretching, and getting out of their office chair to help stimulate their body/increase blood flow. These exercises will be induced and facilitated through web alerts on either their computer or mobile version of this application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The users will be rewarded with having a better mental and physical well-being. This would encourage them to be more productive, confident, and focused as it removes these negative distractions from their schedule. In addition, this system would allow them to be more consistent in maintaining good mental and physical well-being habits as this application will be used on almost a daily basis.
      </p>

  <h2>Part B</h2>

    <h3>Describe Existing Solutions</h3>

      <p>
        There are a few existing solutions that are in the market that have parts of what our application does, but not to the full extent as what we are trying to accomplish. For example, there is a mobile app called Flora that forces users to stay focused on a task at hand, and if they become distracted they will be forced to pay a certain dollar amount (that the user decides) to the company for them to plant trees with the money. The pros of this app is that it makes sure that users are focused on the task on hand that they are working on, or they will have to pay for becoming distracting. But a con would be that while users are arguably more productive with this method, being so consumed by work is not good for your mental or physical well being. Headspace is another very popular application that encourages and teaches users how to mediate in order to help them with their mental health. The pros of this one is that there is tangible evidence that users have increased their mental health through meditation, but throughout a work day it may be hard to just mediate and it does not address the physical well-being aspect of working from home. Both of these solutions are very popular and are very well developed, but they only cater to certain aspects, in this case one app is mainly for productivity and the other for meditation.
      </p>

    <h3>Describe Potential Guidelines and Solutions</h3>

      <p>
        The guidelines we will be using is the idea that we know that with the remote-work era that we are living in, it is hard to both do well at your job/school and be able to keep good mental and physical well-being. We want our users to be able to efficiently complete their work, but between tasks or assignments throughout their day, users will be prompted to engage that will be given to them through the app to help with their physical/mental well-being. In terms of guidelines, we know that our users will be very busy. Because of this, users will be able to input how much time they have to complete one of the tasks the app will give them so they will be able to maximize the free time they have throughout their busy schedules. The app will operate on the principle of self-reporting, meaning that the user’s will be given tasks that will help them both physically and mentally, but at the end it is their responsibility to make sure that they complete the task. As a sort of motivating factor to complete these tasks, the leaderboard will be used and the more tasks that users complete while they are using the app will allow them to increase their rank on the leaderboard.

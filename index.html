                            lack of motivation [1]. With this, the lack of physical interaction and social interaction with others along 
                            with increased workloads because of the pandemic has created a remote work era that has been taxing for many 
                            people in their respective fields of work.

                            The problem of our study is regarding mental and physical health with remote work as a product of the COVID-19 
                            pandemic. While working from home was something that employees enjoyed the convenience of, having to work from 
                            home every day, along with juggling the various outside commitments has been an extreme burden for many people 
                            [5]. As a result, the mental and physical health of individuals has deteriorated.

                                    overall well-being. The mental and physical well-being options can be easily implemented throughout a busy workday to

                                    completed a task or they have not. While users, in theory, could report that they have completed a task while not doing it, we will rely

                            Our users will consist of primarily young adults to middle-age adults (typically in the age range of 20-45 years old). These users will most likely be 
                            college students and working-class individuals who have to do most of their work in a remote environment. According to PWC, employers are expecting a 
                            30 percent shift towards working at home. This pandemic will also most likely possess long-term changes where companies will continue to promote working 
                            from (to some degree) as they will need to pay less for maintaining facilities and programs for in-person work [4].

                            The users will take part in the physical and mental well-being exercises that the application would encourage them to do. As mentioned previously these
                            exercises include meditation, mindfulness, and self-reflection as well as basic movements like walking, stretching, and getting out of their office chair 
                            to help stimulate their body/increase blood flow. These exercises will be induced and facilitated through web alerts on either their computer or mobile 
                            version of this application.

                            it removes these negative distractions from their schedule. Also, this system would allow them to be more consistent in maintaining good mental and physical 
                            well-being habits as this application will be used on almost a daily basis.

                        <p class="content">
                            There are a few existing solutions that are on the market that have parts of what our application does, but not to the full extent of what we are trying to 
                            accomplish. For example, there is a mobile app called Flora that forces users to stay focused on a task at hand, and if they become distracted, they will be 
                            forced to pay a certain dollar amount (that the user decides) to the company. The company then uses this money to plant trees [2]. The pros of this app are that 
                            it makes sure that users are focused on the task on hand that they are working on, or they will have to pay for becoming distracting. A con would be that while 
                            users are arguably more productive with this method, being so consumed by work is not good for your mental or physical well being. Headspace is another very 
                            popular application that encourages and teaches users how to meditate to help them with their mental health [3]. The pros of this app are that there is tangible 
                            evidence that users have increased their mental health through meditation, but throughout a workday, it may be hard to just meditate and it does not address the 
                            physical well-being aspect of working from home. Both of these solutions are very popular and are very well developed, but they only cater to certain aspects 
                            (productivity and meditation) of the challenges that remote work creates.

                        <p class="section-name">Describe Potential Guidelines and Solutions</p>
                        <p class="content">
                            The guidelines we will be using is the idea that we know that with the remote-work era that we are living in, it is hard to both do well at your job/school and be 
                            able to keep good mental and physical well-being. We want our users to be able to efficiently complete their work, but between tasks or assignments throughout their 
                            day, users will be prompted to engage in tasks/activities that will be given to them through the app to help with their physical/mental well-being. In terms of guidelines, 
                            we know that our users will be very busy. Because of this, users will be able to input how much time they have to complete one of the tasks the app will give them so they 
                            will be able to maximize the free time they have throughout their busy schedules. The app will operate on the principle of self-reporting, meaning that the users will be 
                            given tasks that will help them both physically and mentally, but in the end, it is their responsibility to make sure that they complete the task. As a sort of motivating 
                            factor to complete these tasks, the leaderboard will be used and the more tasks that users complete while they are using the app will allow them to increase their rank on 
                            the leaderboard.

                            In our solution, we would create an application to take input from the user about their time-schedule and intervals in which they receive a wellness check. Also, the user 
                            receives an option to specify whether they want to place more emphasis on either mental or physical wellness checks. Users can also conduct self-reporting practices to ensure 
                            that they complete the wellness check acts given by the application. Then after a user has completed a physical or mental well-being exercise, they will be awarded points that
                            will have them ranked on a global leaderboard with other users who interact with the application.

                        <p class="content">
                            The application provides a feature for users to rate their experience with the application - where users can enter feedback to tweak and modify or adjust their experience in the 
                            future. There is no tangible way for us as creators to measure if someone has improved their physical or mental well-being through this application. That being said, we will rely 
                            on users self-reporting their experiences with the application to see how they have been able to improve their well-being, and possible changes to the app to further help our users. 
                            Along with this, the points that the users accrue will also be an indicator to see how engaged users are and how it might be positively affecting them.

                        <p class="content">This is important because the user needs to know when the task requirement is due. This will allow them to efficiently complete the tasks they need to do along with
                             receiving a wellness check. Also the main point of this application is to remind users to complete required tasks.

                        <p class="content">This makes sure that if the user was not able to complete the task in the time that it was scheduled for, we want to give users additional time to be able to complete 
                            their tasks while still receiving wellness checks. We understand the users may not be able to complete tasks on time, so we want to give them the opportunity to complete the task in their time 
                            frame.

                        <p class="content">This user story is important because we want to be able to give the user a physical or mental wellness check that fits their time constraints. This is used because we 
                            want the user to make the best use of their time while improving their physical and mental wellbeing.

                        <p class="content">This is important because the user should be able to see how much they have accomplished while using the app, and it lets them know how they are faring with their tasks. 
                            Also, the user will be able to see where they are on the leaderboard, adding an incentive to complete tasks and perform wellness checks so that more points can be accrued to climb up the leaderboards.

                        <p class="content">A user can press the plus button which will bring them to a new page that allows them to input the details for the task at hand and then add it to their list 
                            of tasks to do. Another way to complete this would be to have a button at the bottom of the page that will bring up a pop up box on the main page that will allow the user to enter in the details for 
                            their task to be completed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternate User Story 6</p>
                        <p class="content">A user can press a checkbox button, in a pop-up window, to indicate whether he has completed the task or not. If a user has completed the task the pop-up will display a message indicating 
                            that the task has been completed (i.e. a large checkbox icon or congratulations message), and then close out. If the task is not completed, the new page will prompt the user to type in a new deadline and 
                            then click a confirmation signifier - such as a button titled "confirm". The window will then close out and the application will resume to normal. Another way to go about this is instead of the user 
                            entering time, there will be quick time increments that the user can add to their deadline.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternate User Story 10</p>
                        <p class="content">A user can enter their amount of time and type of check into the page that is presented so that wellness check activity is assigned to the user for the appropriate amount of time. An 
                            alternative way to complete this would be that users can enter the amount of time they think that they have when they are inputting the task into the task list, and then are given a wellness check using 
                            the preselected time and type.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternate User Story 11</p>
                        <p class="content">A user can tap the View leaderboard label/button to view how they are doing with all the tasks that they have completed/done, and he can view his points. Another 
                            way a user can view the leaderboard is by swiping up on the homescreen. Swiping on the homescreen will lead the user to the leaderboards. Either the user can see the leaderboard on the home screen, or he 
                            can swipe. He can also just press a button to see the leaderboards.

                        <p class="content">Having a button at the bottom of the page will make it easy and clear to the user on how to bring up their user data. The button will act as an effective signifier 
                            for this function of creating a new task. Having it formatted as a pop up box will also make it very easy for this information to be the center of attention, and users will not have to navigate through 
                            pages. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternate User Story 6</p>
                        <p class="content">Having a pop up window to indicate whether or not a task has been is helpful because it will close upon completion of a required task. This will ensure that the user 
                            checks the task off before he continues on the application. Entering the new time in will make it flexible for users to input the amount of time they want, while the quick select time might make it faster 
                            for them to add time.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternate User Story 10</p>
                        <p class="content">Inputting the time and type of wellness check into the task list will make it very simple and logical to the user, and the user will be ready to perform their wellness 
                            check when their task is complete. The alternative is having the info of time and type of check later will allow the user to have more flexibility of what they want to do for their check, along with being fluid
                            with their time constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternate User Story 11</p>
                        <p class="content">Swiping on the home screen will allow for a much bigger screen of the leaderboard. This screen will be more organized and contain a broader array of names. This will be a 
                            more cohesive look at the leaderboard compared to the original small screen of the leaderboard on the other page. The button for the leaderboard might make it easier to navigate because there are dedicated buttons 
                            that take you to and away from the page.

                        <p>User Story 3</p>
                        <p class="content">We decided to go with a new page that the user is sent to after they create the add task button in the top right hand corner of the task box. We thought that a new page for adding a 
                            task would be easier for the user to access and use than a pop up box. On this new page, we decided that there would be 3 main fields: the task name, the description of the task, and the time that it needed to be 
                            completed by. This was chosen because while a name tells you part of the task, the description allows users to input more details about their task. Users can then confirm or cancel their selection, and it will take 
                            you back to the home page.
                        </p>
                        <p>User Story 6</p> 
                        <p class="content">We decided to go with the option for the user to input how much time they want to have added to the task before they are reminded again. We chose this because we realized not all tasks 
                            can be completed by a deadline, and it is much easier and flexible for users to input how much time they want instead of giving them fixed times to add.
                        </p>
                        <p>User Story 10</p>
                        <p class="content">Here we decided to go with the option for users to enter the type of check they want to receive and the time they want to practice the check for when their task has been completed. 
                            After thinking about it, it made more sense for users to decide this when it is time to complete their task, as inputting it when you input your task means that if for some reason when it is time to perform the check 
                            if you need to change the type or time of the check, it is redundant to have to input information. Also, when the screen with the information of the check is up, users cannot leave the screen until the timer for the check 
                            is done. This is because we want users to perform the task for the time and not leave the page until the time of their task is done. [2]
                        </p>
                        <p>User Story 11</p>
                        <p class="content">We decided to go with the button that shows the leaderboard instead of having it be the swipe action. It is often easier for users to navigate the pages with physical buttons. With the swipe 
                            up/down action, it could be difficult to interact with having some accidental swipes, so having the button ensures that users will be able to tap and see what they are wanting to see.

                        <p class="content">We plan on using the following testing methods:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Interviews with Random Participants:
                                <p class="content">Ask participants if they have become more productive while using the application. Ask them how their mental health is. 
                                    Ask certain questions pertaining to mental wellness.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Long-Term Experiments:
                                <p class="content">Measure productivity with users who use the application. Productivity = number of tasks completed.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Surverys:
                                <p class="content">Ask users to rate the app out of five stars. Ask them how the application can be improved. Also we can give the users 
                                    some form of incentive to do the surveys and interviews.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="content">If this app is fully implemented, the testing procedures include the following: assign people in the experiment a set of tasks 
                            to complete. A way to measure productivity is by seeing how many tasks they were able to complete out of the ones they inputted in the:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Control Group:
                                <p class="content">A set of users who are not using the productivity application</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Experimental Group:
                                <p class="content">A set of users who are using the productivity application</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="content">When dealing with informed consent, we are not using any medication/substances that may harm them. We may have to ask the 
                            users/test-subjects personal information such as daily schedule, current mental state, and health condition. The test subject is also not 
                            going through any medical procedures. The data that we are using to measure productivity is the number of tasks completed. If a user completes 
                            more tasks, he/she is going to be more productive. We will also compare the number of tasks the user inputs and completes as a ratio. The higher 
                            the ratio, the higher the users' task completion which is also a signifier of their productivity. With this data, we will be able to identify 
                            and distinguish productive and unproductive users. Based on this, we can then further study and interview the productive peoples' habits and 
                            compare them with the unproductive users. This will help us find new ways that we can further maximize productivity and physical/mental well-being 
                            during the pandemic. Also, all communication will be done online or on the phone so that way we limit person to person contact and lower chances 
                            of spreading COVID-19.
